class Odedata():
    """Class for storing simulation results from any of the dynamics solvers.

    Attributes
    ----------

    solver : str
        Which solver was used ['mesolve','mcsolve','brsolve','floquet']
    times : list/array
        Times at which simulation data was collected.
    expect : list/array
        Expectation values (if requested) for simulation.
    states : array
        State of the simulation (density matrix or ket) evaluated at ``times``.
    num_expect : int
        Number of expectation value operators in simulation.
    num_collapse : int
        Number of collapse operators in simualation.
    ntraj : int/list
        Number of monte-carlo trajectories (if using mcsolve).  List indicates
        that averaging of expectation values was done over a subset of total
        number of trajectories.
    col_times : list
        Times at which state collpase occurred.  Only for Monte-Carlo solver.
    col_which : list
        Which collapse operator was responsible for each collapse in
        ``col_times``. mcsolver only.
